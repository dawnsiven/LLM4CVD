# LLM4CVD: An Experimental Study

This is the codebase for the paper "Investigating Large Language Models for Code Vulnerability Detection: An Experimental Study", which is submitted to IEEE TIFS. The arxiv version of this work is publicly available via [this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18260). We also provide the 🤗Huggingface repository for all evaluated datasets via [dataset link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xuefen/VulResource) and all trained models via [model link](https://huggingface.co/Sak1Rinn/LLM4CVD-models).

To facilitate related communities and encourage future studies, we provide an easy-to-use and unified codebase to implement three graph-based models, two medium-size BERT-based sequence models, and four LLMs to study their performance for the code vulnerability detection task. Our codebase is built on the top of some related codebases provided below (Awesome Helpful Resources).

## How to Run and Evaluate

We provided user-friendly shell scripts to simplify model training and evaluation. These scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory, and their general functionalities are as follows:

```shell
scripts
├── download_hf_models.py          # Download the Hugging Face models used in this repository into `model/`.
├── finetune.sh                     # Fine-tune LLMs for the experiments on Section 6.2 and 6.3.
├── inference.sh                    # Evaluate LLMs fine-tuned using `finetune.sh`.
├── finetune_imbalance.sh           # Fine-tune LLMs for the experiments on Section 6.4.
├── inference_imbalance.sh          # Evaluate LLMs fine-tuned using `finetune_imbalance.sh`.
├── finetune_ablation.sh            # Fine-tune LLMs for the experiments on Section 6.5.
├── inference_ablation.sh           # Evaluate LLMs fine-tuned using `finetune_ablation.sh`.
├── train.sh                        # Train graph-based and medium-size sequence models for the experiments on Section 6.2.
├── test.sh                         # Evaluate models trained using `train.sh`.
├── train_imbalance.sh              # Train graph-based and medium-size sequence models for the experiments on Section 6.4.
├── test_imbalance.sh               # Evaluate models trained using `train_imbalance.sh`.
└── to_graph.sh                     # Convert data into graph format as input for Devign model.
```

Before using these scripts, you need to:
1. Use the `cd` command to set the running directory to the root of this repository.
2. Place all data in the `data/` directory, following the directory structure and file names provided in our open-sourced HuggingFace repository.
3. Install all dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Download the required Hugging Face base models if you plan to run the LLM-based experiments.

The trained models and output log will be generated in the `outputs/` directory.

If you want to download the Hugging Face models used by this repository into the `model/` directory, you can run:

```shell
python3 scripts/download_hf_models.py
```

You can also download only selected models:

```shell
python3 scripts/download_hf_models.py --models codebert graphcodebert unixcoder llama3.2
```

If you are in mainland China and want to use the community mirror, you can either pass the mirror shortcut:

```shell
python3 scripts/download_hf_models.py --mirror china --models codebert unixcoder llama3.2
```

or set a custom Hugging Face endpoint:

```shell
export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
python3 scripts/download_hf_models.py --models codebert unixcoder llama3.2
```

For gated repositories such as Llama / CodeLlama, make sure you have access permission on Hugging Face and set your token before downloading:

```shell
export HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
python3 scripts/download_hf_models.py --mirror china --models llama3.2
```

### FastAPI backend for frontend integration

To let a frontend submit jobs and poll training or inference status, this repository now includes a FastAPI backend in `fastapi_backend/`.

Start the backend from the repository root:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
./scripts/run_fastapi.sh 0.0.0.0 8000
```

After startup, you can open:

- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` for Swagger UI
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

- `http://192.168.3.6:8000/health` for a health check

The main API groups are:

- `POST /api/jobs/classical`: trigger `train.sh` or `test.sh`
- `POST /api/jobs/classical-imbalance`: trigger `train_imbalance.sh` or `test_imbalance.sh`
- `POST /api/jobs/llm`: trigger `finetune.sh` or `inference.sh`
- `POST /api/jobs/llm-imbalance`: trigger `finetune_imbalance.sh` or `inference_imbalance.sh`
- `POST /api/jobs/ablation`: trigger `finetune_ablation.sh` or `inference_ablation.sh`
- `POST /api/jobs/to-graph`: trigger `to_graph.sh`
- `GET /api/jobs`: list all submitted jobs
- `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}`: query one job
- `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}/log`: fetch the tail of the log file for frontend polling

By default the backend enables CORS for all origins. You can restrict it with:

```shell
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:3000 ./scripts/run_fastapi.sh
```

### Quick start

To quickly get started, you can run the following examples:

```shell
# For the experiments on Section 6.2.
./scripts/finetune.sh             reveal  llama3.1  0-512 16    0;
./scripts/inference.sh            reveal  llama3.1  0-512       0;
./scripts/train.sh                reveal  ReGVD     0-512       0;
./scripts/test.sh                 reveal  ReGVD     0-512       0;
# For the experiments on Section 6.3.
./scripts/finetune.sh             mix     llama3.1  128-256 32  0;
./scripts/inference.sh            mix     llama3.1  128-256     0;
./scripts/train.sh                mix     ReGVD     128-256     0;
./scripts/test.sh                 mix     ReGVD     128-256     0;
# For the experiments on Section 6.4.
./scripts/finetune_imbalance.sh   draper  llama3.1  0·2         0;
./scripts/inference_imbalance.sh  draper  llama3.1  0·2         0;
./scripts/train_imbalance.sh      draper  CodeBERT  0·2         0;
./scripts/test_imbalance.sh       draper  CodeBERT  0·2         0;
# For the experiments on Section 6.5.
./scripts/finetune_ablation.sh    reveal  llama3.1  8 16        0;
./scripts/inference_ablation.sh   reveal  llama3.1  8 16        0;
# Llama 3.2 is also supported in LLM scripts.
./scripts/finetune.sh             reveal  llama3.2  0-512 16    0;
./scripts/inference.sh            reveal  llama3.2  0-512       0;
./scripts/finetune_ablation.sh    bigvul  llama3.2  1 16        0;
./scripts/inference_ablation.sh   bigvul  llama3.2  1 16        0;
```

You can modify the command-line arguments in the above examples to perform other experiments mentioned in the paper.
For the ablation scripts, the arguments are `<DATASET_NAME> <MODEL_NAME> <R> <ALPHA> [CUDA]`.

Specifically, the second parameter represents the dataset name, which corresponds to the folder name in the `data/` directory.
You can customize a new dataset (assume it is named `xxx`) by following the template of our open-sourced dataset on the HuggingFace repository. Store it according to the following file structure:

```
data
└── xxx
    └── alpaca
        ├── xxx_0-123_test.json
        ├── xxx_0-123_train.json
        ├── xxx_0-123_validate.json
        ├── xxx_123-456_test.json
        ├── xxx_123-456_train.json
        ├── xxx_123-456_validate.json
        └── ...
```

The third parameter specifies the model name, which has the presetting supported values:

- For scripts prefixed with `finetune` and `inference`, the supported values are: `llama2`, `codellama`, `llama3`, `llama3.1`, and `llama3.2` (all lowercase).
- For scripts prefixed with `train` and `test`, the supported values are: `Devign`, `ReGVD`, `GraphCodeBERT`, `CodeBERT`, and `UniXcoder` (case-sensitive).

Other parameters can refer to the usage within every script.

### Run Devign model

Unlike other models, the Devign model requires data to be converted into graph format before training and evaluation. To simplify this process, we provide the `to_graph.sh` script.

Before converting, you need to download `joern.zip` from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jh5-JJ8BKGL53uAxWjSnEBjw0oRDm_Ss/view?usp=sharing), extract it, and store all the files in the `joern/` directory. Make sure the current user has execute (`x`) permissions for `joern-parse`.

An example of training and evaluating the Devign model is as follows:

```shell
./scripts/to_graph.sh   reveal  0-512;
./scripts/train.sh      reveal  Devign  0-512   0;
```
